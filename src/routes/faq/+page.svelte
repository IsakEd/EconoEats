	<li>How does it work?</li>
	<p>
		To solve this problem using the simplex method, you start by representing the problem as a set
		of linear equations and inequalities. These equations describe the constraints and the objective
		function that you want to optimize. The simplex method then iteratively explores different
		corner points of a geometric shape called a feasible region. This feasible region is defined by
		the constraints of the problem and represents all the valid combinations of variables that
		satisfy the given limitations. At each iteration, the simplex method examines the current corner
		point and checks if it can improve the objective function. It does this by moving to an adjacent
		corner point that provides a better value for the objective function while still satisfying all
		the constraints. The algorithm continues moving from one corner point to another until it
		reaches the optimal solution. The optimal solution is the corner point that gives the best
		possible value for the objective function while meeting all the constraints.
	</p>
	<p>
		The simplex method works by systematically navigating through different corner points,
		evaluating the objective function at each point, and moving to adjacent points that improve the
		objective value. It ensures that every move satisfies the constraints until it finds the corner
		point that maximizes or minimizes the objective. Once the optimal solution is found, the simplex
		method provides the values for the variables that achieve the best outcome according to the
		given constraints and objective function.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>TL;DR</b> the simplex method is an algorithm that explores different corner points within a feasible
		region to find the optimal solution for an optimization problem. It moves from one corner point to
		another, improving the objective value while satisfying the constraints, until it reaches the best
		possible outcome.
	</p>
	<li>Why doesn't it work?</li>
	<p>
		There can be different reasons why a solution isn't found.
		<b>No feasible solution exists</b> is the most common error and arises when the restrictions and
		bounds are too tight. The most common cause for this is that you simply haven't allowed enough food
	</p>

	<p>
		If you have a high protein minimum requirement and at the same time have a very low carbohydrate
		or fat maximum requiremen, it will likely be impossible to meet these requirements if you also
		haven't included a very lean protein source like protein powder or chicken breast.

	<li>Should I start eating only what's prescribed here?</li>
	<p>
		Absolutely not, this site does not prescibe anything! The results you may get here take <b
			>no consideration</b
		> at all whether the diet is safe or sustainable at all. Most likely it is not. The intention of
		this service is just to show off an implementation of an optimization algorithm. Use it to get a
		better overview of what he major costs are in your current or to see how you can lower your food
		costs, what is right for your health is 100% your and your physician's responsibility to find out.

	<li>Why can't you optimize for health?</li>
	<ol>
		<li>There is no objective measure of how healthy a food is</li>
		<p>
			There are lots and lots of outstanding and accredited nutritionists and scientist who have a
			lot of knowledge about nutrition, and most all of them disagree wildly on several points.
		</p>
		<li>Health means different things for everyone</li>
		<p>
			The term "Healthy" means very little on its own. If your view of health is living until your
			100's, you might have different needs from someone who considers health to be defined by how
			strong and mobile you are, or how free you are from a certain disease. If you're a young
			strength athlete, your healthy protein intake may be unhealthy for a person with kidney
			issues. The creator of this website is a mechanical engineer and knows essentially nothing
			about nutrition.
		</p>
		<li>There often isn't enough information on the labels to determine</li>
		<p>
			Even if there was some magic formula for determining the objective healthiness of a specific
			food, the variables would be mostly unknown. Some of the micronutrients are included on the
			label, but there are phytonutrients, antinutrients, enzymes, antioxidants, pesticides that
			probably play a role as well, which aren't even known by anyone for many foods.
